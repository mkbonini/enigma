# Enigma
### programmed by: Mike Bonini

## functionality (4/4)
I have completed the cracking method with command line interface

## Object Oriented Programming (3.5/4)
I implemented a module and where all the helper methods are stored. I am borderline if this is actually helping readability of the code but I felt it is cleaner and helped me get practice with modules.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics (3.5/4)
I used a lot of good enumerables and can speak to why I feel they are best choice.  There a few methods longer than 10 lines.

## Test Driven Development (3/4)
I did not use mocks and stubs but 100% of my code is tested.

## Version Control (4/4)
while I do not have 40 commits I feel I have used pull requests and commits well.  Key features were implemented using branches and code in each commit is concise.
